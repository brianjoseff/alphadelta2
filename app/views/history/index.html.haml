    %h1 THE HISTORY OF ALPHA DELTA FRATERNITY 
    %b The Founding of the Fraternity
    %p Since the founding of Dartmouth College, literary interest has been strong amongst its students, and as soon as Dartmouth had reached sufficient size, literary societies began to form. In the late 18th century times were indeed hard in Hanover. The opportunity to share books, to have good conversations, and to find critical review for one's literary works, were appreciated by the student body. For these reasons, groups were formed to promote literary excellence. Alpha Delta was one of the first groups, and although the size of the group was small, it had outstanding leadership, and accomplished much good work.
    %p There was an Alpha Delta Society at Dartmouth as early as 1799. It was known as the Literary Adelphi, the Adelphian Society, or the Alpha Delta Society. This group was formed to promote literary excellence among its members. They set up a common library, and enjoyed extemporaneous speeches given each week. A highlight of their work was a series of annual addresses given before each graduation exercise.
    %p During the late 18th century, the College recognized four societies. These were Phi Beta Kappa, the Social Friends, the United Fraternity, and the Theological Society. Alpha Delta was a reluctant member of the United Fraternity, because the College prohibited membership in any society other than the four recognized ones. Alpha Delta was formed because the larger societies did not provide an effective opportunity for public debate, nor did they offer an opportunity for close fraternal ties. Known as the Independent Confederacy before their affiliation with the United Fraternity, the Dartmouth Literary Adelphi announced the formation of their society in the Dartmouth Gazette on October 26, 1799. Cyrus Perkins, the president, announced that meetings would be held on the first Friday of each month, and that the library would be expanded. Due to the pressure from the rival Friends Society, however, the organization enjoyed independence for only a few years. The College eventually banned the Alpha Delta Society.
    %p Neither the College nor the Social Friends, however, could thwart the desire for membership in this literary brotherhood. The Alpha Delta traditions were taken up again in 1821. This time the society associated itself with the Antinomian, and undertook its affairs in secret. Little is known of the procedures within the organization because of the tightly maintained veil of secrecy. It is known that weekly meetings were held for debate and literary discussions. They also gave addresses at graduation exercises. Their medal has been preserved, however, and was a simple pendant of silver, little more than an inch square.
    %p The Antinomian became Gamma Sigma in March 1843. At this time it was revealed that the outgoing president of this organization had been Professor Crosby, and his successor was to be Professor Lord, the incoming President of the College. This change of leadership and name accompanied an enlarged role for the organization in the social arena. In this respect, the change was a move to resemble the modern fraternity. Now, in 1841, the modern Greek letter fraternities began to form, and employed the chapter system.
    %p Psi Upsilon was the first of the nationally affiliated societies on campus. Alpha Delta Phi was the second, formed in 1846. It was formed by the sophomore members of Gamma Sigma, who had formed the Tau Delta Theta fraternity in 1843. With the assistance of the Yale and Amherst chapters of Alpha Delta Phi, the acceptance of Tau Delta Theta into the national organization of Alpha Delta Phi was arranged. In March of 1846, the installation took place in Professor Sanborn's office. There the charter was produced and signed, and the Dartmouth Chapter of Alpha Delta Phi was created.
    %b The History of the House
    %p The Fraternity set up operations in Dartmouth Hall until 1911, when a new house was built to the west of the College Green. This was the second building at the College built expressly for fraternity life. Kappa Kappa Kappa was the first. In 1920 the Fraternity sold its house to Chi Phi Fraternity, and began building its current structure on East Wheelock Street. The house, when completed, was dedicated to Melvin O. Adams, class of 1871, "...in grateful and appropriate recognition of his prominence in the Fraternity, his unfailing interest in the Chapter, and his substantial aid in building the house." The "smoker" was completed and dedicated to Henry Augustus Sage. This room was later to become the TV room, and eventually a pool table was added and the room was dubbed the "sports bar". The library was dedicated to the memory of Robert Augustus Eckert and Edwin Henry Parkhurst of the class of 1957. In the years that followed, this room was used as a pool-room, a brothers only bar and sitting room. In the fall of 2011 this room was renovated and returned to its original use as a library - a comfortable and convenient place for brothers to study, and a repository for books used in courses at the College. The cost of the renovations were funded by the AD Class of 1977 in memory of their fraternity brother, Neal (Groucho) Webber '77, who had died in 2010 following a courageous battle with cancer.
    %p In June of 1989, a photograph and inscription in memory of Will Shue '83 was installed in this room, in a ceremony attended by his classmates, fraternity brothers, and family, including his brother, Andrew Shue '89. Will had been a brother, officer, and dedicated alumnus of the Fraternity, who had died in a tragic accident in the summer of 1988. In the fall of 1997 the friends and family of John Higgins '96 gathered in the GB to dedicate a memorial to John, who had died tragically that summer. John was a dedicated brother who had served as "jock chair" of the Fraternity, and he was widely admired and respected for his friendliness and commitment to his fraternity brothers. In the winter of 1998, the family and friends of Alex von Summer '60 placed a memorial to Alex in the GB. Alex had died the previous summer in a motorcycle accident. He had been a dedicated and generous alumnus and served on the Alumni Advisory Board for the Fraternity. On homecoming weekend 2002, a large group of undergraduates, alumni, and the friends and family of Chris (Dom) Colasanti '90 dedicated a memorial plaque to Dom. He had been killed in the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Those who gathered in his memory, including his widow, Kelly, spoke movingly of his unique personality, and the enormous impact that he had had on their lives and their Dartmouth experience.
    %p During the year 2000 the basement was extensively renovated, and as a result of a mandate from the Dartmouth Board of Trustees, the permanent bar was removed from the basement, along with the tap system and cooler. At this time, with no more cooler/tap systems permitted on campus, it is proper to note that the first self-contained tap system/cooler at Dartmouth was installed in the basement of the Alpha Delta house in September of 1957.
    %b Changes and Challenges
    %p In 1969, during the presidency of Douglas Reynolds '69, the Fraternity decided that the traditions of the local chapter could best be preserved by disaffiliation from the national organization of Alpha Delta Phi. The Fraternity changed its name to Alpha Delta, which was to symbolize the return to the literary traditions, which were purely Dartmouth in nature and spirit. In 1980, and again in 1985, efforts were made by Alpha Delta Phi to entice the local Fraternity back into the fold. Despite some financial incentives, the undergraduate brotherhood elected to remain a local Fraternity, and this decision was heartily supported by the alumni.
    %p In the early 1980's the Dartmouth Fraternity system found itself under assault. Efforts were made to abolish the system, and the trustees mandated that the system reform itself. This led to the introduction of a set of standards, conceived by the IFC and the College administration, which all fraternities would have to meet if they were to remain an officially recognized organization. Standards existed in the area of behavior, membership, finances, leadership, programming, and physical plant. After the concerted effort by the undergraduate members, a successful fund raising drive amongst the alumni, and an investment of over $70,000.00 in the physical plant, Alpha Delta Fraternity was deemed to have satisfied all the standards in the fall term of 1985.
    %p In the winter of 1991, the brotherhood of Alpha Delta made a difficult and momentous decision. As a result of a fundamental disagreement between the Fraternity and the Dartmouth administration over the efficacy of sanctions imposed upon the Fraternity, the brothers voted unanimously to declare the Fraternity's independence from the College. This decision was endorsed by the Alumni Corporation, and on January 10, 1991, Alpha Delta officially separated from Dartmouth College. All realized that this decision carried with it certain risks, but all believed that such a move was in the best interests of the Fraternity. Soon thereafter, another five fraternities followed AD's example and declared their independence from the College.
    %p In 1992, Dean of the College Lee Pelton, at the behest of the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College, mandated that the Greek System must be unified, and imposed a regulation that as of April 1, 1993, no registered Dartmouth student could live in an unaffiliated fraternity house. As this would effectively eliminate the primary source of revenue for Alpha Delta, we entered into negotiations for our reaffiliation with Dartmouth College. During the winter term these negotiations were completed, and on March 29, 1993 Alpha Delta reaffiliated with Dartmouth College, under very favorable conditions, in good standing, and with no sanctions imposed. The decision two years earlier to cut our formal ties to the College had been a controversial one, but one made on principle. The time spent as an independent fraternity was successful, and in many ways helped to strengthen the brotherhood. The terms of reaffiliation, we believe, justified the original decision.
    %p In the winter of 1999 the Greek system once again came under considerable pressure from the Board of Trustees, with the announcement of the Student Life Initiative. There was some sentiment that these organizations should be abolished, but after significant pressure from the alumni, the Board reconsidered and mandated significant reforms. We are still in the process of implementing these reforms, and while there are many questions yet to be answered, the Fraternity continues to prosper and the dedication of the brothers, both undergraduate and alumni, remains extraordinary. This has been amply demonstrated by the progress made towards  meeting the expectations that are a part of the Student Life Initiative. One of the challenges that all organizations must meet is to bring their physical plants into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the current building code of the town of Hanover. For most houses, this will entail a considerable financial investment. In response to this challenge, the alumni of Alpha Delta have contributed over $250,000 during the years 1999-2002, which enabled the Fraternity to meet the new physical plant expectations without incurring debt. A wheelchair ramp and wheelchair accessible bathroom were installed, major structural improvements were completed, and preparations were made to install a wheelchair lift, all between the years 2002-2008. New front and back porches were built, and alterations to several 2nd floor suites were made. These changes, and the extraordinary alumni support that made these possible, are testament to the commitment of all Alpha Delts, and places the Fraternity in an exceedingly strong position as we enter the 21st century.
    %p In 2011 Dartmouth found the Fraternity guilty of a number of violations of College policy. As a result, Alpha Delta was placed on College probation and required to re-examine its Constitution, By-Laws and other governing documents. This process was undertaken in early 2012, at which time the brotherhood committed itself to embrace the principles of leadership, brotherhood, accountability, service & philanthropy, scholarship and diversity. A vision statement was written and a two-year plan for growth was created. These can be found in this manual and it is expected that all new members of Alpha Delta will embrace these ideals, aspirations and commitments.
    %b Animal House
    %p In 1978 a cultural phenomenon opened in movie theaters around the country. The movie was Animal House, written primarily by Chris Miller '63, and based on his experiences and his fraternity brothers at AD during the early 1960's. Chris is a graduate of the College and Tuck School who, following a successful career in advertising, began writing for The National Lampoon in the early '70s. His short stories - Tales from the Adelphian Lodge, the Night of the Seven Fires, and Tales from the Adelphian Lodge, Pinto's First Lay - were well received by the readers of The National Lampoon, and generated the idea of a screenplay based on Chris' short stories. No one truly expected the film to be as successful as it was, but it received largely positive reviews, and became the highest grossing comedy in the history of films (to that time). It is not too strong a statement to say that it has become a classic, and has made Alpha Delta at Dartmouth, perhaps the most famous fraternity in the U.S.
    %p Chris Miller has returned to AD on numerous occasions, has been a regular contributor to our fund raising efforts, and in the spring of 2008, he returned to Hanover with a film crew from The Biography Channel to film a 30th anniversary tribute to Animal House. The crew spent the better part of a weekend on campus, filming interviews with alumni and undergraduates of the fraternity, as well as a toga party hosted by AD. They returned in May for Green Key where Otis Day and the Knights performed at our traditional Green Key Lawn Party. While the finished product was a major disappointment due to the short shrift given to the filming on campus, the opportunity for the undergraduates to meet and party with Chris and some of his contemporaries from AD was appreciated by all.
    %p While the movie Animal House was largely fiction, Chris attempted to set the record straight when his book, The Real Animal House, was published in 2006. Unlike the movie, the book had limited appeal and was not particularly successful, though it proved to be very popular with the brothers and alumni of the fraternity, and once again focused attention on the antics and good times at Alpha Delta at Dartmouth.
    %b Unique Memorial to Alpha Delta Servicemen
    %p The "Brothers-in Arms" statue is a unique type of trophy, which exists in no other fraternity. Authorized in 1920, the statue is a memorial in grateful tribute to the 2300 men of the national Alpha Delta Phi, both of Canada and the United States, who served in World War I, and especially the 93 brothers who made the supreme sacrifice.
    %p The noted sculptor, Col. Robert Aitken, was commissioned to do the memorial in 1920. His monuments and statues may still be seen in many cities throughout the United States, and his major work was the nine-figured sculpture on the face of the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C. The embodiment of the memorial was a statue in bronze, representing two young officers, one an American and one a Canadian, wounded and helping each other through the fire of battle. They signify brotherhood, service, leadership and sacrifice, and are intended for all time as a reminder to the generations of Alpha Delts of the ideals of the Fraternity.
    %p The Dick Hall Memorial Fireplace
    %p This memorial, in the south end of the Great Hall was dedicated to Richard Hall '14, who was the first American to die in World War I. He died in Alsace on Christmas Eve, 1914, while serving in the Ambulance Corps. The inscription reads "Make a Big Fire in the Fireplace for Dick". The mantle and fireplace were extensively restored to their former glory in the winter of 2009. This was long overdue, and marks the beginning of an effort to upgrade the condition of the Great Hall. Another memorial to Dick Hall may be found inside the lower west entrance of Baker Library.
    %b The Alpha Delta Tradition
    %p When one chooses to join Alpha Delta Fraternity, one joins a long tradition of accomplishment and commitment to the Fraternity, the College, and the Nation. Our list of prominent alumni is long and distinguished. To name just a few:
    %ul 
      %li Salmon P. Chase 1826, Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court

    %p Alpha Delta is also known for involvement with a wide variety of activities on the Dartmouth Campus. Over the past quarter century alone, Alpha Delts have served as class presidents, presidents of the Student Assembly, the IFC, and the Inter-dormitory Council; Chair of the CFS Judiciary Committee; Editor-in-Chief of The Dartmouth and the Stonefence Review; captains of the football team, soccer team, squash team, swimming team, rugby team, tennis team, golf team, track team, lacrosse team, and both light and heavyweight crews. During the same period brothers have been honored with the Dean's Prize for service to the Dartmouth Community, Class of 1948 Scholar-Athlete Award, Class of 1950 Award, Timothy Wright Ellis Award, Kenneth Archibald Prize, and the Barrett Cup for all-round achievement, as well as numerous academic honors including valedictorian, Phi Beta Kappas, and winners of Reynolds, Marshall, Fulbright and Rotary fellowships for graduate study abroad.
    %p There is another tradition of Alpha Delta Fraternity of which we are all justifiably proud. The Fraternity's predecessor, Alpha Delta Phi, was unique amongst national fraternities, in that its by-laws never contained discrimination clauses. The Fraternity never excluded members on the basis of race, religion, or other forms of prejudice. Racism and other forms of intolerance have no place in this organization, and never will.
    %p The loyalty of AD alumni to their Fraternity is one of the true strengths of the organization. The alumni return in large numbers every year, and our annual fund raising drive is among the most successful on campus. We encourage our alumni to return to the house whenever they are in Hanover, and it is the responsibility of all undergraduates to make them feel at home.
    %p As undergraduate members of Alpha Delta, you are expected to display that same loyalty and commitment, and to always act in the best interests of the Fraternity. The brothers and alumni of Alpha Delta have a tradition of reflecting credit upon their Fraternity, their College, and their community, and as the newest members, you are expected to live up to that tradition.
